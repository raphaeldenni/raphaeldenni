### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm RaphaÃ«l Denni, a french IT student. I will update this page to complete my profile very soon. 

Currently, I have a TODO list to rewrite and update some of my repos :

- [ ] Complete my profile ([See here](https://github.com/raphaeldenni/raphaeldenni))
- [ ] Create a real portfolio website ([See here](https://github.com/raphaeldenni/raphaeldenni.github.io))
- [x] Rewrite my two fun Python repos ([See here](https://github.com/raphaeldenni/zorglangue-traductor) and [here](https://github.com/raphaeldenni/dvd-player-sleep))
- [ ] Finish my Discord bots ([See here](https://github.com/raphaeldenni/NewsBot) and [here](https://github.com/raphaeldenni/CleanBot))
